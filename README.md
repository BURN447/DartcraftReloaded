Dartcraft Reloaded is a revival of an old classic, one which dissapeared off the radar many years ago. 

The largest focus of the mod is on tools, which are upgradable and customizable, however in a much different way than many of us are used to. These tools are upgraded in the Force Infuser, a block that is obtained by crafting a force rod and an enchantment table together. In this force Infuser, you must combine Liquid Force and certain Modifiers that will give your tools different effects, from Auto-Smelting Pickaxes to Flying swords, there is a huge number of possibilities that you can create with these tools.

I plan of creating a mod that is very similar to the original, however not an exact carbon copy.

This mod is in early beta, so there is much still being worked on. There is a lot of progress being made and I hope to bring a lot of hours of play to many people.
